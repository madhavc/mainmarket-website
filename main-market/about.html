In 2015, Main Market fully recovered from its loss and had complete remodel. With the same owners Main Market's first priority has always been freshness, quality, and great customer service.  These high standards of quality and service and a strong work ethic have been the keys to the store's success and are the reason for the strong loyalty between  Main Market and its customers.  </p>
